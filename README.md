## Introduction
After the tragic loss of the Custom Hotel, we wanted to dedicate our customizable language to the fallen Westchester landmark. Much like the Custom Hotel, we want our language to appeal to everyone in the community and foster an environment where people can come together to share their unique version of the language. To make this possible, Custom features keywards that you define in a customizable JSON. Each person's version of Custom is truly their own. When you see "CUSTOM," you know you are home.

## Features
-Statically-typed programming language
-Every keyword comes from a JSON file that the user can customize
-Typing "Juno" causes a compile error ("Hotel Juno" is the disappointing successor to the "Custom Hotel")
